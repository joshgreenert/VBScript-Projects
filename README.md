VBScript is a language supported by Microsoft that provides can be used to provide solutions within Microsoft products.  Although I strongly recommend Google products over Microsoft on any given day, I have attempted to create some snippets of code for general purposes;  additionally, I have created others just to test the limits and capabilities of Excel in comparison.  My findings were that Excel doesn't support custom functions that provide more than one cell of data as a return value.  For instance, an array of data cannot be returned through VBScript with Excel, neither explicitly or implicitly.  However, I have found a workaround to "technically" return more than one value that is listed below.
